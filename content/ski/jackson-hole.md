# Jackson Hole
*About coming soon*

I dream about how rugged and untouched Jackson Hole was back in the day. I can't even imagine being there in its heyday, incredible terrain with an undercurrent of cowboy spunk. Now it feels overdone and a tourist trap. The town really leans into the kitschy cowboy aspect, and the mountain is not big enough for the traffic it gets. Even though we were there outside of holiday season, it was entirely skied out (of course, no thanks to the lack of snowfall). The day after it dumped about a foot was a dream, but by the next day it was completely run through again. It was dealer’s choice between iced-out groomers and 8+ foot tall moguls. I love moguls as much as the rest, but at some height they desperately needed to get cut down. Jackson Hole will forever stand as a mecca for skiers, especially having contributed to freeriding and the fame of Corbet’s Couloir, but I do not necessarily need to go back. The area is beautiful though (it is the Grand Tetons of course), and I would love to give Grand Targhee a go as a less tracked alternative. While a lot of the town was cheap souvenirs, there were some beautiful western art galleries, and line dancing by the locals. Again, it was worth the trip once, and I’ll definitely be in the area again, even if it isn’t at Jackson Hole. That being said, it would be great to come back during a better snow year…
