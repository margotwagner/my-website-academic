# Alta
Alta lies in the wasatch mountains and is one of the oldest ski resorts in the US, with the first lift opening in 1939. Since 2002, it is connected to Snowbird either off of the Wildcat lift (double blacks) or off the backside through Snowbird's Mineral Basin. The duo lie in Little Cottonwood Canyon, which has a particular microclimate that accumulates more snow than most other Utah resorts. Along with Deer Valley, Alta is one of the few remainined resorts that prohibits snowboarding while its counterpart (Snowbird) does not. Despite going to court for this, the ruling was maintained. It is known for its particularly challenging in-bounds ski area including long, straight, fall-line pitches. Future expansions include a tram to the top of Mt. Baldy, lifts from Sugar Bowl to Sugarloaf pass (currently a traverse), and better parking.

Alta and Snowbird are technically connected, but the vibe feels different, highlighted especially by the fact that Snowbird allows snowboarders (snowbirders?) while Alta devoutly does not. This does inevitably mean that Snowbird can get skied out (snowboarded out) quicker. Both have a variety of runs and difficulties because they are really part of the same mountain range. There’s everything you could possibly want – steeps, trees, etc. It’s the place to go if you want to ski hard. At the beginning of our time in SLC, the snow was miserable, so it almost wasn’t even worth wasting days here, but with the multiple powder dumps towards the end, this was the place to be. I ended up demoing powder skis here for a day that we got over a foot since lifts closed, and it was dumping the whole day, and I am obsessed. Absolutely one of the best ski days of the whole season. 

Alta doesn’t allow snowboarders, and as a result there’s a bit of a chicken-egg situation with the vibe there. It is on average a much older crowd and can be a bit stuffier. That being said, there is some merit to it because it’s a lot easier for snowboarders (speaking as someone who snowboards as well) to clear new snow off a run with the I’m-not-good-enough-for-this-run sideways slide down the mountain. As such, powders sticks longer, and the runs don’t get as icy as quickly. If there’s no new snow, it’s difficult everywhere though because of the rocks. Everything off High Traverse is a great time with good snow as well as Wildcat. Supreme lift has good steeps up higher then some cruising glades lower down. Skiers that are regulars at Alta are some of the bests in the US. On a busy day, the lifts can get backed up, but I love Alta. It’s worth it.  

Vibe: locals (typically old men) and families; some nutty younger skiers.
