# Big Sky
Big Sky is the second largest resort in the US (after Park City) but is rugged in a way Park City is not. It lies mostly on the eastern face of Lone Mountain which can be accessed using the Lone Peak Tram. The tram, which accesses expert terrain, was once included in the daily lift tickets. While "lift tickets" generally include access to *all* the lifts at a resort, this year Big Sky decided to add a daily fee ranging from \$20-\$80/day to use it (typically $80). Big Sky was originally founded in 1973 by Chet Huntley (great name), retired co-achorman of *The Huntley-Brinkley Report* of NBC News. 

What once was an extremely rugged mountain reserved for ski nuts with the advent of first ever US triple black diamonds is quickly becoming Vail-ified. For whatever reason, the resort has decided it wants to focus on boujie clientele with lift tickets priced at $235, limited and unaffordable lodging options nearby, and a loud and over-the-top apres scene. With their Big Sky 2025 plan, it's just going to get worse. Lone Mountain, the beautiful and daunting top peak of Big Sky, is going to be converted to a much bigger tram that can be accessed from the bottom of the resort. Complaints about Lone Peak lines are about to look more ridiculous when the apres crowd can ride up from the bottom just to meander then ride down. Big Sky seems to want to be a Jackson Hole and Vail child, but Montana-sized. Unfortunately, there is still some of the best skiing here. There's world-class versions of everything you could possibly want: park, steeps, trees. It's one of the few US resorts with runs that require checkout with ski patrol. 

Vibe: rich out-of-towners and pissed off locals
