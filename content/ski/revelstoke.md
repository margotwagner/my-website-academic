# Revelstoke
Revelstoke is a relatively new mountain, having only opened in 2007. Despite having a huge skiable area, there's veritably only three lifts: the main gondola, Stoke chair, and Ripper chair. It usurped Whistler Blackcomb as the longest vertical descent of any ski resort in North America (5620 ft) which logically gave it the longest run in North America and the 4th longest in the world at 9.6 miles (The Last Spike). More than anything, it's known for its powder and big mountain terrain, and the resort added Sno-Cat and Heliskiing tours. 

Revelstoke is my ski heaven. We arrived at night, so the next morning we found ourselves in a valley, surrounded by towering mountains. There were scarcely any buildings in the town and each one was adorned with 2-3 feet of fresh powder, promising a magnificent day on the mountain. And so it was. The mountain was an absolute powder playland, and the smile couldn’t be torn from my face. It was a gigantic mountain, both vertically and area-wise, and it sure felt like it, especially with only one gondola and two lifts. Revelstoke presented itself as a proper mountain, with the peak not visible from the base, even when the sky was clear. We didn’t even realize at first that it had the largest vertical in North America but just kept getting absolutely exhausted by the end of the runs (really by the middle even). 

The snow never truly stopped while we were there, with the peak going in and out of the clouds. It occasionally got a bit socked in with the snowfall at the top, which made it hard to see, but the new snow was worth it and provided a comfortable landing for any fall. Due to the sheer size of the mountain and the quantity of snow, it seemed the mountain could never truly be skied out. There were always pockets of powder everywhere you looked. I remember being at the top of the lift just thinking to myself “okay, which powder spot do I want to play in now.” There was countless glade runs (my favorite) and breathtaking views. Saturday was a bit rough in the morning since it was the day after a snowstorm (a perfect powder day), and the limited lifts presented significant bottlenecks. Luckily it cleared out pretty quickly around lunchtime, and the long powdery runs proved worth the wait. I absolutely cannot wait to go back and do heliskiing.
