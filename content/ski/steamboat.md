# Steamboat
Steamboat Ski Area is located in Steamboat Springs on Mount Werner in the Park Mountain Range. It first opened in 1963 using the name “Storm Mountain Ski Area” but was changed only two years later after the mountain was renamed after local Olympian Buddy Werner. As of this year, the total number of winter Olympians with ties to Steamboat Springs is 100, making it the “Land of 100 Olympians”. The town has had representation in every winter Olympics since 1932, except for 1936, due to its rich history in ski jumping and both Nordic and downhill skiing. Howelsen Hill, located 10 minutes from Steamboat Ski Area, is the oldest continuously operating ski area in the US, operating since 1915. It has the largest and most complete natural ski jumping complex in North America and has been the training ground for 95 Olympians making over 165 Olympia appearances total. Steamboat Ski Area itself is home to Mavericks Superpipe, one of the few premier half-pipes in North America. Since 2013, Steamboat also has limited night skiing available.

Steamboat is an incredibly family-friendly ski area with a large range of terrain abilities. In my opinion, the only thing is lacks is very difficult steep terrain at the upper end of the skill level, which is pretty typical of many Colorado resorts. On the other hand, there’s some great cruising glades. The area gets a lot of snow, making it a great place to hang out and ski casually. Getting around the mountain can be a bit slow, especially if you’re trapped behind a family on the numerous catwalks. It can get really busy, so I would avoid going there during any “school” holidays if it can be avoided (ie winter or spring break). The local kids are impossible to miss because they will rip past you in packs with absolutely no fear.
