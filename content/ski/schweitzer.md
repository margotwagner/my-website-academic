# Schweitzer
Schweitzer is settled in the northern Idaho panhandle, about 45 miles from the Canada - US border. Overlooking the beautiful Lake Pend Oreille (the 38th largest lake by area in the US), twilight skiing provides an unreal sunset. The resort just became a part of the Ikon pass this year, and is definitely up-and-coming. The mountain was named after an old Swiss ex-military hermit who lived at the bottom of the basin. Interestingly and disturbingly, a crime investigation involved the search of his house which uncovered the bodies of many local cats that had gone missing. Local legend said he enjoyed cat stew.

Schweitzer feels like it’s up-and-coming. If I had any money lying around, this is where I’d invest it. It’s still about 30 mins from any grocery store, but the town is being built up as we speak. Between the front and back sides of the mountain, it felt like there was plenty to do. There was some nice bowls and trees. It does feel like they do not know that it is actually an option to warn people about hazards on the trails (ie a caution sign before a rock drop off), but as long as you scope it out ahead of time, you’re pretty good to go. There is a nice beginner area at the bottom, which I always like because it sequesters them in one area. When we first got there, the snow was hard and we’d have to wait until later in the day once it softened up in the sun to really hit some runs and even then it was limited to where the sun had shown. Luckily by the last day, we got a few inches, which made for some unbelievable lines. Also, on the weekends, they have twilight skiing. The view overlooking the lake, especially during sunset, is a must see. 

Vibe: locals with more and more out-of-towners on the way
