# Schweitzer
Schweitzer is settled in the northern Idaho panhandle, about 45 miles from the Canada - US border. Overlooking the beautiful Lake Pend Oreille (the 38th largest lake by area in the US), twilight skiing provides an unreal sunset. The resort just became a part of the Ikon pass this year, and is definitely up-and-coming. The mountain was named after an old Swiss ex-military hermit who lived at the bottom of the basin. Interestingly and disturbingly, a crime investigation involved the search of his house which uncovered the bodies of many local cats that had gone missing. Local legend said he enjoyed cat stew.
