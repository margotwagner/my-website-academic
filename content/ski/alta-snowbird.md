*Review coming soon*
Alta and Snowbird are technically connected, but the vibe feels different, highlighted especially by the fact that Snowbird allows snowboarders (snowbirders?) while Alta devoutly does not. This does inevitably mean that Snowbird can get skied out (snowboarded out) quicker. Both have a variety of runs and difficulties because they are really part of the same mountain range. There’s everything you could possibly want – steeps, trees, etc. It’s the place to go if you want to ski hard. At the beginning of our time in SLC, the snow was miserable, so it almost wasn’t even worth wasting days here, but with the multiple powder dumps towards the end, this was the place to be. I ended up demoing powder skis here for a day that we got over a foot since lifts closed and it was dumping the whole day. Absolutely one of the best ski days of the whole season. Alta and Snowbird will
- Snowbird has more free-riding
- Cloud lift was sick
- Mineral basic is cool but the snow is usually worse back there


*Pictures and videos coming soon*
