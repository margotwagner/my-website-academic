# Deer Valley
Deer Valley, located in the Wasatch Range, built its first runs in 1936 and was host to the 2002 Winter Olympics. Often it is ranked the “top” ski resort in the US, primarily based on its amenities, including free ski valets and parking shuttles, fine dining options on the mountain, and boutique shopping. Even more so than the average ski resort, it caters to a more “upscale audience”. In that vein, they also prohibit snowboarders. 


Do not get me wrong, deer valley has some great runs. The hike-to chutes are great with enough snow, plus there’s some good cruising glades. It’s also got a range of terrain for all levels. That being said, it is hands-down without a doubt, the boujiest ski resort I have ever been to (so far?). The amenities push for a certain clientele that is unmissable. If you are on the market for a ski bunny or a trust fund guy really into crypto, then this is your kind of place. The lines can get backed up, but on the plus side, they tend to die down almost immediately after lunch even on the busiest days and are concentrated to the lifts servicing greens and blues. It’s the kind of place that has bathrooms with heated floors, floor to ceiling wooden stall doors, and reusable hand towels to dry. At the same time, the stalls have no racks to put your gloves on and marble bathroom floors with no rugs, making walking in ski boots difficult. There is a certain clientele, and I don’t meet it. It’s a place to go on a bad snow day or if all your other days are used up…    

Vibe: wealthy families, ski bunnies, crypto boys
