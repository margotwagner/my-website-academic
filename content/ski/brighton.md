# Brighton
Brighton, along with Solitude, is in the Wasatch Range of the Rockies in Big Cottonwood Canyon. It boasts a long history as the first ski resort in Utah and one of the first in the US, opening in 1936 with a rope tow. It’s considered a “no-frills” resort and acts as such, with standard parking, limited food options, and many brown bag lunch spots. Offering a single ride lift ticket option, Brighton also opens up to extensive backcountry access. Though it still counts as a full day, it is connected to Solitude via the SolBright run, which is relatively new and definitely not for beginners. Brighton offers a lot in the way of park riding from small to extra-large features, so a lot of pros got their start here. It is also one of the few resorts offering night skiing.

Brighton, in my opinion, has some of the best glades I’ve ever skied. They take over a significant portion of the mountain and range in difficulty – although there isn’t anything that will really kill you like some of the other resorts. On a powder day, you can just cruise trees here effortlessly and endlessly, soon finding yourself in a flow state. The night skiing is a great benefit (although it does count as a full day on the Ikon pass even if you only go at night). If you aren’t into park skiing then there’s not a lot of difficult runs once the sun sets because skiing trees becomes dark and dangerous. The resorts doesn’t have much in the way of steeps compared to Alta, Snowbird, or even its neighbor, Solitude. Luckily Solitude is (currently) unlimited days, so you can always split time if you want a bit more of a challenge. Everywhere you look at Brighton, there’s park rats who have likely been riding park since they could walk. There’s nothing quite as humbling as a 10-year-old ripping features that you would never even imagine doing.
