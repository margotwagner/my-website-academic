# Red Mountain
Red mountain is in Rossland, a former Canadian gold mining town. It’s one of the oldest ski hills in North America, having opened in the first decade of the 1900’s and is actually Western Canada’s first alpine resort. Although generally geared towards intermediate and expert skiiers,  it does have some easier terrain for the whole family. There’s 4 separate peaks – Red, Granite, Grey, and Kirkup -- the latter of which is only accessible by cat skiing, which was unfortunately not open while we were there. Michel Trudeau, Justin Trudeau's younger brother, worked there and was living in Rossland before he died during a backcountry skiing trip.
