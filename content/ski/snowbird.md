# Snowbird
Snowbird opened in 1971 and sits next to Alta in Little Cottonwood Canyon in the Wasatch mountain range. Unlike Alta, it allows for both skiing and snowboarding. This canyon is considered the second snowiest ski areas in US after the cascades, but its dry and light rather than humid and wet making for significantly better skiing. Like Alta, it is known for its challenging terrain.

Snowbird *does* allow snowboarders, which brings in an entirely different crowd and attitude. The snowboarders and skiers are a lot younger and absolutely rip. Go to Little Cloud lift on a powder day, and you’ll see. It becomes a massive playground with people doing tricks I’ve only seen on TV just casually off any rock or mound they can find. The bottom parts can get skied out pretty quickly by beginners, but anything black diamond or above takes a while. Skier’s left has beautiful trees to get lost in for hours while skier’s right has good steeps. Without the drop in, hot foot gully is Snowbird’s response to Corbet’s. Mineral Basin, the back side, is a beautiful wide-open bowl but takes a lot more snow to fully cover than the front side or Alta. Overall, some of my favorite skiing. Pair it with Alta, and it’s an unbeatable combination.
