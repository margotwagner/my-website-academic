# Solitude
Solitude is also in Big Cottonwood Canyon in the Wasatch Mountain Range, neighboring Brighton. It is considered to be relatively family friendly, with a range of runs for all skill levels. Unlike Brighton, it is a more typical ski resort without much park riding. If anything, it is sort of a smaller version of Snowbird, with steeps and challenging upper limits for the runs. There is also extremely difficult sidecountry runs here available via hikes. It was first developed by uranium tycoon Robert M. Barrett, who decided to start his own ski resort after being denied the use of the restrooms at Alta, which were reserved for Alta guests only. In response, he bought all the land in Big Cottonwood Canyon, the next canyon of from Little Cottonwood Canyon, where Alta is. 

Unlike some of the other resorts, Solitude still feels local and underappreciated. Because there’s less traffic than elsewhere and there’s good tree coverage, it holds the snow the best. At the beginning of our stay, we found ourselves going here often because there were still untouched tracks if you know where to look. It also remains as the only Utah resort with unlimited days, so it was a great place to get a couple laps in without worrying about burning a day. Solitude has a generally steeper pitch than Brighton resulting in steeper pitches and a higher ceiling for run difficulty.
