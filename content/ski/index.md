## Revelstoke 
Revelstoke is a relatively new mountain, having only opened in 2007. Despite having a huge skiable area, there's veritably only three lifts: the main gondola, Stoke chair, and Ripper chair. It usurped Whistler Blackcomb as the longest vertical descent of any ski resort in North America (5620 ft) which logically gave it the longest run in North America and the 4th longest in the world at 9.6 miles (The Last Spike). More than anything, it's known for its powder and big mountain terrain, and the resort added Sno-Cat and Heliskiing tours. 

My review:

## Red Mountain 
Red mountain is in Rossland, a former Canadian gold mining town. It’s one of the oldest ski hills in North America, having opened in the first decade of the 1900’s and is actually Western Canada’s first alpine resort. Although generally geared towards intermediate and expert skiiers,  it does have some easier terrain for the whole family. There’s 4 separate peaks – Red, Granite, Grey, and Kirkup -- the latter of which is only accessible by cat skiing, which was unfortunately not open while we were there. Michel Trudeau, Justin Trudeau's younger brother, worked there and was living in Rossland before he died during a backcountry skiing trip.

My review:

## Schweitzer
Schweitzer is settled in the northern Idaho panhandle, about 45 miles from the Canada - US border. Overlooking the beautiful Lake Pend Oreille (the 38th largest lake by area in the US), twilight skiing provides an unreal sunset. The resort just became a part of the Ikon pass this year, and is definitely up-and-coming. The mountain was named after an old Swiss ex-military hermit who lived at the bottom of the basin. Interestingly and disturbingly, a crime investigation involved the search of his house which uncovered the bodies of many local cats that had gone missing. Local legend said he enjoyed cat stew.
