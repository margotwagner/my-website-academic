I am excited about modernizing how we treat and diagnose mental health through tech. I also hope to make science, tech, and healthcare more understandable, accessible, and equitable. Feel free to reach out to discuss an idea or grab a coffee!

Also here you'll find my passions including skiing, travelling, comedy, writing and more!
