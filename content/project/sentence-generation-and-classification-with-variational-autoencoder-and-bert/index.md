title: Sentence Generation and Classification with Variational Autoencoder and BERT
summary: Given a sentence (premise), the goal is to write a hypothesis that either agrees, contradicts, or says nothing about the premise. A conditional variational autoencoder uses a premise and class label to generate a hypothesis specific to that class type. Then, a BERT model is used to classify the results in order to evaluate the style transfer to generating the sentences.
